# Quick and dirty build script for CS105.X
#
# NOTE: To run this script, you'll need:
#
# 1. The master parse tool, which is in the databricks/training repo.
#    Depending on where you checked that repo out, you may need to change
#    the "master_parse" variable, below.
# 2. The "gendbc" tool, which is in the databricks/training repo, under
#    devops/gendbc. This tool is written in Scala and must be installed
#    per the README.md in its source directory. It only requires a JVM
#    to run, but this script assumes "gendbc" is in your PATH.
